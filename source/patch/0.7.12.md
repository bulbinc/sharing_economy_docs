## 0.7.12

[Feature] #142: Add a tidelift_url option, which when set (default is None/unset) adds a small text snippet to the donate.html sidebar component, linking to the given URL string. Thanks to Steven Loria for the patch.

[Feature] #132: (partially via #143) Add a generic donation badge/url option (visually powered by https://shields.io/) as well as a service-specific donation option for OpenCollective.

We expect this to be followed-up on later with more service-specific options for services like Patreon. Thanks to Melanie Crutchfield for the report and Steven Loria for the initial patch.

[Bug] #141: Fix a typo in the code-block font family, which incorrectly specified Deja Vu Sans Mono instead of DejaVu Sans Mono. This would primarily impact systems lacking the first two fonts (Consolas and Menlo) such as Linux desktops. Thanks to Ilya Trukhanov for catch & patch.

[Bug] #128: Remove Gittip/Gratipay output from the donate.html sidebar component, since the actual service has been insolvent since 2017. The configuration options remain in place for the time being (to avoid breaking backwards compatibility) but no longer do anything. Thanks to Joe Alcorn for the report / original patchset.

Note
See the changelog entry for #132, which re-introduces a more generic donation sidebar framework.
